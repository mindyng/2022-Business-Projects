    "Many product-focused companies rely on quick user feedback on experimental product changes to remain relevant and to maintain a moat with their competitors. In order to get that feedback quickly in a cost-effective way, an experiment is performed on a sample of the whole population/user base. \n",

    "Currently embedded in Product team at medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",
